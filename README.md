# Overview
The programming language LISP, developed in 1958, is one of the oldest languages still in common use. The language is famous for: being fully parenthesised (that is, every instruction is inside its own brackets), having a prefix notation (e.g. functions are written (PLUS 1 2) and not (1 PLUS 2)) and its efficient linked-list Car/Cdr structure for (de-)composing lists. Here, I have developed a very simple language inspired by these concepts called NUCLEI and a means to parse or interpret the instructions.
